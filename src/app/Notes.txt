When the component loads 
 - The constructor executes first present in component.ts file 
 - next ngOnit() method executes

This is because the performance/logic to fetch Data from DB 
through APIs is writtent in constructor and ngOnit

constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) {} => this means it imports other class objects/variables
after injecting use them with this.
